# Network Architecture Design
As you work through the various elements it is important to have structure in your workflow.





---
An example of a design document structure is presented below:
1. Introduction
2. Requirements for the Design
3. Existing Infrastructure
    * Layer 1 Topology
    * Layer 2 Topology
    * Layer 3 Topology
    * Audit Results
    * Recommendations
4. Intelligence Services
    * Applications
    * Services
    * Analysis
    * Recommendations
5. Solution Design
    * Design Summary
    * Design Details
    * Implementation Details
    * Recommendations
6. Prototype Network
    * Prototype Details
    * Prototype Results
    * Recommendations
7. Implementation Plan

Using this you could create checklists such as:

- [ ] Network Analysis
- [ ] Constraints
- [ ] Assumptions
- [ ] Drawbacks
- [ ] Risk Assessment
